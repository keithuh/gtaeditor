# gtaeditor
GTA Editor is an application (or game) made with Godot Engine for viewing the map of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

### How to install
I haven't compiled any executables, until there's a stable and working version, you'll have to do it yourself.

First, download the latest version of Godot Engine. Then, clone this repository by downloading it as a zip file. Download these addons and place them in the addons folder:

Sky3D: https://github.com/TokisanGames/Sky3D

Ocean: https://github.com/tessarakkt/godot4-oceanfft

Next, place the game files in the `gta` folder, run the project, select the `scenes/map.tscn` scene, and press play, enjoy!
